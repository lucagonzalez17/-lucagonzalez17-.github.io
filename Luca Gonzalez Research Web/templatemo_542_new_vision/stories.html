                                    <p>One of the fields in football in which Big Data is more implanted is the transfer market.After all ,football clubs are companies that move millions of pounds every year and they do not want to waste any money in bad signings.The application of analytics in the football transfer market has shifted the paradigm because nowadays medium or low level teams are capable of making intelligent operations scouting market opportunities ready to have impact on the team.An example of this situation is the signing of N’Golo Kante for Leicester City F.C  (English Premier League) in 2015.The mathematical model developed by the analysts of the East Midlands team showed that according to their playing style they needed a midfielder capable of stealing many balls and launching the counterattack.He was bought  in August for 5.6 million pounds (£) and played 37 games Nobody knew at the time that this team would end up winning the Premier League(English First Division) due in large part to the work of Kante(World Cup 2018 Champion with France).</p>

                                    <p>Players data sets are one of the most used aspects in football statistical analysis,the causes are easy to understand.Clubs need to classify and store thousands of data with the intention of leaving nothing behind.A well known case related to this is Roberto Firmino signing for TSG Hoffenheim(German Bundesliga) in 2011.Firmino,a Premier League champions and Brazil international now,was playing in Brazil’s Second Division(Campeonato Brasileiro Serie B) a year before.Lutz Pfannenstiel,lead scout of Hoffenheim at the time,has stated that he found about Firmino because of a videogame called Football Manager.( Joe Mewis,2016)Football Manager(Sega Sports Interactive)is a football team management simulator with a database highly detailed in which there are 799,643 players.</p><a rel="nofollow" target="_parent" href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/roberto-firmino-discovered-hoffenheim-director-9280292">Related article</a>

                <p class="tm-partner-text">Productivity is what matters in Analytics.A perfect example for this is F.C Barcelona(Spanish LaLiga) rival analysis method in which every investigator is in charge of watching the matches of six teams in the Spanish First Division (LaLiga).This team of three analysts produces models for detecting weaknesses and strengths,each one does this for their six teams and all of them does it for Real Madrid C.F(Spanish LaLiga) that is the biggest rival.This information is transmitted to the coach and the assistant who tries to asses game plans to communicate to the players during training sessions.(Carlos Marcos,2017)</p>
                <p class="tm-partner-text">An example of deep analysis that helps produce favorable situations in the game is the Liverpool F.C(English Premier League) pass analysis model.(Developed by Ian Graham)(Bruce Schoenfeld,2019) This model provides the percentage of possibility of each pass that a player can make at a specific moment.To explain this ,they analyze the value of each pass (“if it is good idea to make the pass”) depending on the chances of reaching another Liverpool player (“harder”-“easier”-“players in between”) how much benefit would the team get if the pass goes well and how much benefit would the rival get in case of intercepting the pass.Examining each pass helps you to review the decision-making on the squad and thus be able to correct them.Another clear example is that when a player is in apressure situation he is more prone to shot towards his side of confidence and this can be predicted.This way coaches can be helped in their decision making in tactic aspects,nowadays there is very high demand of analysts who generate information in real time.Now they can reduce the uncertainty of substitutions and strategic changes in game.</p>
