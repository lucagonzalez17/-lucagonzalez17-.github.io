                               <p> To find the roots of statistical analysis in football we have to go back to the 1950s.Charles Reep ,accountant in the British Royal Air Force ,was the pioneer of this science.He started collecting information about matches by simply taking notes about what he was seeing,after a period of time doing this he came with a theory that ended up changing British football.He stated that “no more than three passes” were needed to score a goal and this statement ended up becoming the most recognizable style of play in the UK Leagues( “long ball” ,”kick and rush” ).Years on Reep ideas were prove wrong because his analysis was too simplistic and football  is a complex game but took the right path.He proved that the ability to understand the data is more important than just the data.( Bernard Marr ,no date; Soccerment,2020)
The next great advance in football analysis was produced during 1990s when the use of video footage as a tool for post and pre-match breakdown of matches became popular.Many teams adopted the idea of analysing their next rival last match in order to find their weaknesses and strengths,it was also used for transfers but there was still a lot to advance.
The book Moneyball (Lewis,2004) started a trend in sport that did not take long to reach football and influenced a lot of the people that is working now in the sector.

                                <p>Football is the most popular sport in the world ,it has a social and political significance different from other sports.There is a general thought that football has a distinctive soul unlike other games.The traditional view of the game is very relevant in football and maybe that is why the idea of Big Data is more implanted in other sports.There is still a suspicion both in public and in private since it is tried to preserve this special nature of football. And yet, the use of Data Science is more of a habit in football.It is a tool that you have to use because otherwise you are competing at a disadvantage you have a science that offers you things that your eyes do not see and that is the big difference.(Krockel,2019)</p>
